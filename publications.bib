abstract = {Machu Picchu originally functioned as a palace within the estate of the Inca emperor Pachacuti between ~1420 and 1532 CE. Before this study, little was known about the people who lived and died there, where they came from or how they were related to the inhabitants of the Inca capital of Cusco. We generated genome-wide data for 34 individuals buried at Machu Picchu who are believed to have been retainers or attendants assigned to serve the Inca royal family, as well as 34 individuals from Cusco for comparative purposes. When the ancient DNA results are contextualized using historical and archaeological data, we conclude that the retainer population at Machu Picchu was highly heterogeneous with individuals exhibiting genetic ancestries associated with groups from throughout the Inca Empire and Amazonia. The results suggest a diverse retainer community at Machu Picchu in which people of different genetic backgrounds lived, reproduced, and were interred together. Individuals buried at Machu Picchu are highly genetically diverse exhibiting ancestries from throughout the Inca empire.}}

abstract = {Summary
There are many unanswered questions about the population history of the Central and South Central Andes, particularly regarding the impact of large-scale societies, such as the Moche, Wari, Tiwanaku, and Inca. We assembled genome-wide data on 89 individuals dating from ∼9,000-500 years ago (BP), with a particular focus on the period of the rise and fall of state societies. Today’s genetic structure began to develop by 5,800 BP, followed by bi-directional gene flow between the North and South Highlands, and between the Highlands and Coast. We detect minimal admixture among neighboring groups between ∼2,000–500 BP, although we do detect cosmopolitanism (people of diverse ancestries living side-by-side) in the heartlands of the Tiwanaku and Inca polities. We also highlight cases of long-range mobility connecting the Andes to Argentina and the Northwest Andes to the Amazon Basin.

abstract = {Evidence of intentional dental modification practices has been found throughout Mesoamerica dating from the Early Preclassic period to the conquest. The recovery of 102 modified teeth from Midnight Terror Cave (MTC) provides a sufficiently large sample to critically examine current explanations of intentional dental modification. Paleogenomic analysis was employed in order to test hypotheses which link intentional dental modification to sex and kinship. DNA was extracted and genomic sequencing libraries were made for 27 teeth. Results show the presence of both sexes, indicating that the practice is not sex linked. The mitochondrial genome data detects a possible link between intentional dental modification and style.}

    abstract = {Here we report the results of excavation and interdisciplinary study of the largest child and camelid sacrifice known from the New World. Stratigraphy, associated artifacts, and radiocarbon dating indicate that it was a single mass killing of more than 140 children and over 200 camelids directed by the Chimú state, c. AD 1450. Preliminary DNA analysis indicates that both boys and girls were chosen for sacrifice. Variability in forms of cranial modification (head shaping) and stable isotope analysis of carbon and nitrogen suggest that the children were a heterogeneous sample drawn from multiple regions and ethnic groups throughout the Chimú state. The Huanchaquito-Las Llamas mass sacrifice opens a new window on a previously unknown sacrificial ritual from fifteenth century northern coastal Peru. While the motivation for such a massive sacrifice is a subject for further research, there is archaeological evidence that it was associated with a climatic event (heavy rainfall and flooding) that could have impacted the economic, political and ideological stability of one of the most powerful states in the New World during the fifteenth century A.D.},

 abstract = {The Franklin expedition set sail in 1845 in search of the Northwest Passage through the Canadian Arctic. During the first winter in the Arctic, three crewmen died of unknown causes. In the 1980s, Dr. Owen Beattie and his colleagues conducted autopsies, which indicated that all three may have suffered from tuberculosis at the time of death. In the present study, a bone sample from one of these individuals, Private William Braine, was analyzed for ancient DNA belonging to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Tests based on both the polymerase chain reaction and next-generation sequencing were carried out. The results show that it is unlikely that tuberculosis contributed directly to his death. L’expédition de Franklin a dressé les voiles en 1845, à la recherche du passage du Nord-Ouest, dans l’Arctique canadien. Pendant leur premier hiver dans l’Arctique, trois membres de l’équipe sont morts de causes inconnues. Dans les années 1980, le Dr Owen Beattie et ses collègues ont réalisé des autopsies, et celles-ci ont permis de constater que les trois hommes en question souffraient peut-être de tuberculose au moment de leur mort. Dans la présente étude, un échantillon d’os de l’un de ces hommes, soit le soldat William Braine, a été analysé afin d’en prélever l’ADN ancien appartenant au Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Des tests basés sur la réaction en chaîne de la polymérase et le séquençage de nouvelle génération ont été effectués. Selon les résultats, il est peu probable que la tuberculose ait entraîné directement la mort de ce soldat.},

    abstract = {We assessed the ability of whole genome amplification (WGA) to improve the efficiency of downstream polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) directed at ancient DNA (aDNA) of members of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC). Using extracts from a variety of bones and a tooth from human skeletons with or without lesions indicative of tuberculosis, from multiple time periods, we obtained inconsistent results. We conclude that WGA does not provide any advantage in studies of MTBC aDNA. The sporadic nature of our results are probably due to the fact that WGA is itself a PCR-based procedure which, although designed to deal with fragmented DNA, might be inefficient with the low concentration of templates in an aDNA extract. As such, WGA is subject to similar, if not the same, restrictions as PCR when applied to aDNA.},
